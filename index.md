# Annie Rose Rondot's first CS193 Homework
- I love the logic behind code
- I'm not really sure how good I will be at it
- But I am hoping that I am able to learn it well enough this year
- My other option would be a math major and that would be boring with not many job options so lets hope I end up loving Computer Science!!
